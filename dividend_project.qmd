'''
This is a personal project that is designed to showcase skills in data science.
I am interested in applying some of the models from class; specifically 
logit models, lasso models, and a classification method utilizing LDA. 

The goal is to be able to build a model that predicts whether a company will
issue dividends in the next quarter using previous financial data.
